## About the Video Course
Firebase makes web application development fast and easy. It frees developers from having to build many backend services.

In this course, you will build four different projects—ranging from creating a Serverless Web Application to displaying data from a database, building an authentication system to verify users, creating a blog that updates in real time, and finally building a chat application.

By the end of the course, you will have learned to integrate Firebase into your application and use it as a powerful backend to create great applications by reducing the cost of backend functionalities and time spent developing applications.
